# SHOT_CLOCK
NBA Predictor application

## Description 
An application that allows the user (preferablly an NBA fan) to pick their favorite NBA team and then predict if they think that their team will win or lose, as well as, predict the final score! Our group of developers are sports fans, and we wanted to find a way to make watching games more exciting! Most NBA fans can find the middle part of the season a bit boring because of the long duration of the season, so our app will add some excitement to the slower parts of the season. 

## Installation 
To use our app simply go to https://shot-clock.herokuapp.com/

## Usage 
Our app is fairly simply to use, when the goes to the link, they will start at the login/sign-up page, from there, they enter their information to continue. After, the user will land on the homepage. Within the homepage, there is a youtube card that can play higlights of NBA games, and a list of all the NBA teams, the user just selects two of the teams. After that, the user has landed on the predictions page, where they will be given the two teams that they selected, and three options. The user will be able to select one of the two teams they selected and who they think will win, what the score from the winning team will be, as well as the score of the losing team. Once they have selected, the user hits submit and the information will be stored. The user can either go back to the homepage, and select two more teams, or they simply logout.
