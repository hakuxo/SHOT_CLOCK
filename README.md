# SHOT_CLOCK

NBA Predictor application

## Description

An application that allows the user (preferablly an NBA fan) to pick their favorite NBA team and then predict if they think that their team will win or lose, as well as, predict the final score! Our group of developers are sports fans, and we wanted to find a way to make watching games more exciting! Most NBA fans can find the middle part of the season a bit boring because of the long duration of the season, so our app will add some excitement to the slower parts of the season.

## Installation

To use our app, simply go to https://shot-clock.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Our app is fairly simply to use. When the user goes to the link, they will start at the login/sign-up page. From there, they enter their information to continue. After, the user will land on the homepage. Within the homepage, there is a YouTube card that can play higlights of NBA games, and a list of all the NBA team logos. The user just selects one team. After that, the user has landed on the predictions page, where they will be given the statistics from the 2021 season and a predictions form. The user will be able to input, against any opposing team, who they think will win, what the score from the winning team will be, as well as the score of the losing team. Once they have selected, the user hits submit and the information will be stored. The user can either go back to the homepage, and select another team, or they simply logout.
